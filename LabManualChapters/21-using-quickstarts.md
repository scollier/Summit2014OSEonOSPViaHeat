#**Lab 21: Using quickstarts**


**Server used:**

* localhost

**Tools used:**

* rhc
* git

A key tenet when Red Hat was designing OpenShift Enterprise was the ability for developers to be able to run their source code and application as is, without having to use proprietary API(s).  To illustrate how easy it is for developers to get an existing application deployed on OpenShift Enterprise,  the team has created a Github space where they provide numerous quick start projects that make deploying common open source applications to the platform a painless task.  Some of the popular open source projects the team provides quick starts for are:

* Drupal
* Review Board
* Wordpress
* Frog CMS
* Sugar CRM
* Redmine
* MediaWiki

##**Install a quickstart**

Point your browser to the following URL:

    http://www.github.com/openshift
    
Given the number of available quick starts, you may have to use the search functionality of your browser to locate the quick start that you would like to install.  For this lab, choose either the Wordpress or Drupal quick start and follow the instructions provided to install the application.
