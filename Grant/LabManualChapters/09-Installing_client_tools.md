#**Lab 9: Installing the RHC client tools**

**Server used:**

* localhost

**Tools used:**

* ruby
* sudo
* git
* yum
* gem
* rhc

The OpenShift Client tools, known as **rhc**, are built and packaged using the Ruby programming language.  OpenShift Enterprise integrates with the Git version control system to provide powerful, decentralized version control for your application source code.

OpenShift Enterprise client tools can be installed on any operating system with Ruby 1.8.7 or higher.  Instructions for specific operating systems are provided below. It is assumed that you are running the commands from a command line window, such as Command Prompt, or Terminal. If you are using Ruby Version Manager (rvm) see the instructions below.

##**Microsoft Windows**

###**Installing Ruby for Windows**

[RubyInstaller 1.9](http://rubyinstaller.org/) provides the best experience for installing Ruby on Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7. Download the latest 1.9 version from the [download page](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and launch the installer.

**Important**: During the installation, you should accept all of the defaults.  It is mandatory that you select the "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" check box in order to run Ruby from the command line.

After the installation is complete, to verify that the installation is working, run:
	
	C:\Program Files\> ruby -e 'puts "Welcome to Ruby"'
	Welcome to Ruby

If the 'Welcome to Ruby' message does not display, the Ruby executable may not have been added to the path. Restart the installation process and ensure the "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" check box is selected.

###**Installing Git for Windows**

The next step is to install [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.com/) so that you can synchronize your local application source and your OpenShift application. Git for Windows offers the easiest Git experience on the Windows operating system and is the recommended default - if you use another version of Git, please ensure it can be executed from the command line, and continue to the next section.

Download and install the [latest version of Git for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git). Ensure that Git is added to your PATH so that it can be run from the command line. After the installation has completed, verify that Git is correctly configured by runing:

	C:\Program Files\> git --version
	git version 1.7.11.msysgit.1

###**Installing RHC for Windows**

After Ruby and Git are correctly installed, use the RubyGems package manager (included in Ruby) to install the OpenShift Enterprise client tools. Run:

	C:\Program Files\> gem install rhc

RubyGems downloads and installs the rhc gem from www.rubygems.org/gems/rhc. The installation typically proceeds without errors. After the installation has completed, run:

	C:\Program Files\> rhc

##**Mac OS X**

###**Installing Ruby for OS X**

From OS X Lion onwards, Ruby 1.8.7 is installed by default. On older Mac systems, Ruby is shipped as part of the [Xcode development suite](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and can be installed from your installation CD. If you are familiar with Mac development, you can also use [MacRuby](http://macruby.org/) or see the Ruby installation page for [help installing with homebrew](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

To verify that Ruby is correctly installed run:

	$ ruby -e 'puts "Welcome to Ruby"'
	Welcome to Ruby
	
###**Installing Git for OS X**

There are a number of options on Mac OS X for Git. We recommend the Git for OS X installer - download and run the latest version of the dmg file on your system. To verify the [Git for OS X installation](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/), run:

	$ git --version
	git version 1.7.11.1

###**Installing RHC for OS X**

With Ruby and Git installed, use the RubyGems library system to install and run the OpenShift Enterprise gem. Run:

	$ sudo gem install rhc

After the installation has completed, run:

	$ rhc -v

##**Fedora 16 or later**

To install from yum on Fedora, run:

	$ sudo yum install rubygem-rhc

This installs Ruby, Git, and the other dependencies required to run the OpenShift Enterprise client tools.

After the OpenShift Enterprise client tools have been installed, run:

	$ rhc -v

##**Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 with OpenShift entitlement**

The most recent version of the OpenShift Enterprise client tools are available as a RPM from the OpenShift Enterprise hosted Yum repository. We recommend this version to remain up to date, although a version of the OpenShift Enterprise client tools RPM is also available through EPEL.

With the correct entitlements in place, you can now install the OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 client tools by running the following command:

	$ sudo yum install rubygem-rhc
	
If you do not have an OpenShift Enterprise on the system you want to install the client tools on, you can install ruby and rubygems and then issue the following command:

	$ sudo gem install rhc

##**Ubuntu**

Use the apt-get command line package manager to install Ruby and Git before you install the OpenShift Enterprise command line tools. Run:

	$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full rubygems git-core

After you install both Ruby and Git, verify they can be accessed via the command line:

	$ ruby -e 'puts "Welcome to Ruby"'
	$ git --version

If either program is not available from the command line, please add them to your PATH environment variable.

With Ruby and Git correctly installed, you can now use the RubyGems package manager to install the OpenShift Enterprise client tools. From a command line, run:

	$ sudo gem install rhc
